# Percona XtraBackup - Documentation

*Percona XtraBackup* is an open-source hot backup utility, for
*MySQL* - based servers, that does not lock your database during the
backup.

Whether it is a 24x7 highly loaded server or a low-transaction-volume
environment, *Percona XtraBackup* is designed to make backups a seamless
procedure without disrupting the performance of the server in a production
environment. [Commercial support contracts are available](http://www.percona.com/mysql-support/).

*Percona XtraBackup* can back up data from *InnoDB*, *XtraDB*,
*MyISAM*, and MyRocks tables on *MySQL* 8.0 servers as well as *Percona Server for MySQL*
with *XtraDB*, *Percona Server for MySQL* 8.0, and *Percona XtraDB Cluster* 8.0.

**_Version Updates_**

Version 8.0.6 and later supports the MyRocks storage engine. 
An incremental backup on the MyRocks storage engine does not 
determine if an earlier full or incremental backup 
contains the same files. **Percona XtraBackup** copies all 
MyRocks files each time it takes a backup.
**Percona 
XtraBackup** does not support the TokuDB storage engine. 

_See Also_ [Percona TokuBackup](https://docs.percona.com/percona-server/latest/tokudb/toku_backup.html) 

*Percona XtraBackup* 8.0 does not support making backups of databases
created in versions prior to 8.0 of *MySQL*, *Percona Server for MySQL* or
*Percona XtraDB Cluster*. As the changes that *MySQL* 8.0 introduced
in *data dictionaries*, *redo log* and *undo log* are incompatible
with previous versions, it is currently impossible for *Percona XtraBackup* 8.0 to also support versions prior to 8.0.

Due to changes in MySQL 8.0.20 released by Oracle at the end of April 2020,
*Percona XtraBackup* 8.0, up to version 8.0.11, is not compatible with MySQL version 8.0.20 or
higher, or Percona products that are based on it: Percona Server for MySQL and
Percona XtraDB Cluster.
