# *Percona XtraBackup* 8.0.7

*Percona* is glad to announce the release of *Percona XtraBackup*  8.0.7 on August 7, 2019.
Downloads are available from our [download site](https://www.percona.com/downloads/Percona-XtraBackup-LATEST/) and from
apt and yum repositories.

*Percona XtraBackup* enables MySQL backups without blocking user queries, making it ideal
for companies with large data sets and mission-critical applications that cannot
tolerate long periods of downtime. Offered free as an open source solution, it
drives down backup costs while providing unique features for *MySQL* backups.

In release 8.0.7, *Percona XtraBackup* enables making backups of databases
that contain the [encrypted system tablespace](https://www.percona.com/doc/percona-server/8.0/security/data-at-rest-encryption.html#data-at-rest-encryption).
Encrypted mysql tablespace is now also supported.

*Percona XtraBackup* 8.0.7 implements the support of the `lz4` compression algorithm
so that you could make compressed backups using lz4
(â€“compress=lz4) in addition to the default quicklz method.

All *Percona* software is open-source and free.

## New Features and Improvements


* Add support of the system tablespace encryption. More information in
[PXB-1649](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PXB-1649).


* Implemented the support of the lz4 compression algorithm. More information
in [PXB-1857](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PXB-1857).

## Bugs Fixed


* When the *encrypted tablespaces* feature was enabled, encrypted and compressed
tables were not usable on the joiner node (Percona XtraDB Cluster) via SST
(State Snapshot Transfer) with the xtrabackup-v2 method. Bug fixed
[PXB-1867](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PXB-1867).


* `xbcloud` did not update date related fields of the HTTP header when
retrying a request. Bug fixed [PXB-1874](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PXB-1874).


* `xbcloud` did not retry to send the request after receiving the HTTP 408
error (request timeout). Bug fixed [PXB-1875](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PXB-1875).


* `xtrabackup` did not accept decimal fractions as values of the
`innodb_max_dirty_pages_pct` option. Bug fixed [PXB-1807](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PXB-1807).


* If the user tried to merge an already prepared incremental backup, a
misleading error was produced without informing that incremental backups may
not be used twice. Bug fixed [PXB-1862](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PXB-1862).
