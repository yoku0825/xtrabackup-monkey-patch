:Date: February 2, 2022
:Installation: `Installing Percona XtraBackup <https://www.percona.com/doc/percona-xtrabackup/8.0/installation.html>`_

Percona XtraBackup enables MySQL backups without blocking user queries, making it ideal for companies with large data sets and mission-critical applications that cannot tolerate long periods of downtime. Offered free as an open source solution, it drives down backup costs while providing unique features for MySQL backups.

Release Highlights
=================================================

The following list contains a number of the bug fixes for *MySQL* 8.0.27, provided by Oracle, and included in Percona Server for MySQL:

* The ``default_authentication_plugin`` is deprecated. Support for this plugin may be removed in future versions. Use the ``authentication_policy`` variable.
* The ``binary`` operator is deprecated. Support for this operator may be removed in future versions. Use ``CAST(... AS BINARY)``.
* When a parent table updated or deleted a row, this operation initiated a cascading ``SET NULL`` operation on the child table. On the child table, a virtual column value could be set to NULL instead of the value derived from the base column value.
