- :jirabug:`PXB-1982`: The `history` table showed a wrong value for ``lock_time``.
- :jirabug:`PXB-2099`: ``copy-back`` did not move undo files to the *data directory*.
- :jirabug:`PXB-2107`: If the `undo tablespace` was created in a
  directory which is a symbolic link to another directory then the
  backup failed at backup stage.
- :jirabug:`PXB-2118`: Undo log file was renamed incorrectly to undo tablespace name after restore
