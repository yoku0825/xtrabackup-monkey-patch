:Date: September 2, 2021
:Installation: `Installing Percona XtraBackup <https://www.percona.com/doc/percona-xtrabackup/8.0/installation.html>`_

Percona XtraBackup enables MySQL backups without blocking user queries, making it ideal
for companies with large data sets and mission-critical applications that cannot tolerate
long periods of downtime. Offered free as an open source solution, it drives down backup
costs while providing unique features for MySQL backups.

Improvements
================================================================================

* :jirabug:`PXB-2477`: The xbcloud should retry on error and utilize incremental backoff (Thanks to Baptiste Mille-Mathias for reporting this issue)
* :jirabug:`PXB-2580`: With the xbcloud binary, a chunk-upload on an SSL connect error to S3 was not retried (Thanks to Tim Vaillancourt for providing the patch)
* :jirabug:`PXB-2317`: Remove the obsolete LOCKLESS binary log functionality since the ``performance_schema.log_status`` table is now used to get the log information on all the storages without locking them



Bugs Fixed
================================================================================

* :jirabug:`PXB-2101`: The Prepare step fails due to duplicate Serialized Dictionary Information (SDI) (Thanks to Fungo Wang for reporting this issue)
* :jirabug:`PXB-1504`: The FIND_GCRYPT macro is broken (Thanks to Maxim Bublis for reporting this issue)
* :jirabug:`PXB-1961`: The Prepare step of a full backup fails for encrypted tables with a generic error
* :jirabug:`PXB-2585`: XtraBackup fails to backup archive RocksDB Write-Ahead Log (WAL) files
