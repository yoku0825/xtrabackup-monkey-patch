.. option:: --no-version-check

   This option disables the version check. If you do not pass this option, the
   automatic version check is enabled implicitly when |program| runs
   in the ``--backup`` mode. To disable the version check, explicitly pass
   the ``--no-version-check`` option when invoking |program|.

   When the automatic version check is enabled,|program| performs a
   version check against the server on the backup stage after creating a server
   connection. |program| sends the following information to the server:

   - MySQL flavour and version
   - Operating system name
   - Percona Toolkit version
   - Perl version

   Each piece of information has a unique identifier which is an MD5 hash value
   that Percona Toolkit uses to obtain statistics about how it is used. This value is
   a random UUID; no client information is either collected or stored.
